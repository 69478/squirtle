                About Squirtle
            </h3>

            Squirtle is a water-type Pokemon introduced in Generation I.
            It evolves into Wartotle starting at level 16, which evolves into Blastoise starting at level 36.
            Along with Bulbasaur and Charmander, Squirtle is one of the three first partner Pokemon of Kanto available
            at the beginning of Pokemon Red, Green, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen.
            <br><br>
            Squirtle is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles a light-blue turtle. While it typically walks on its
            two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish, or
            reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end
            of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens
            after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between
            the two halves.
            <br><br>
            Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved,
            rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokémon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can
            spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be
            found around small ponds and lakes. Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous
            regions, as shown in Pokémon Snap and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. In the Pokémon the Series episode Beach
            Blank-Out Blastoise, Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their
            evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Squirtle is known
            to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell. It does this to protect itself from threats
            while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping.
